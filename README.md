_The Socket.IO chat app tutorial, and then the homework_

## History

The other day at work we got talking about real time and sockets etc. Naturally the topic of socket.io came up, and I realized that I had never built something using it. Then the idea of chat apps came up, and I realized I had never built a chat app.

Am I even a real developer if I've never written a chat app? Am I a cool developer if I don't know how to write node?

This is me stumbling my way though...
